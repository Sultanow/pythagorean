#The Challenge and aim of this project is to find four squares whose difference in each is again a square

This challenge is inspired by the question [Four squares such that the difference of any two is a square?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3286376/four-squares-such-that-the-difference-of-any-two-is-a-square) on Math Stack Exchange.

I published my first trials, code and ideas on Math Stack Exchange using the post [For integers x<y<z, why are these cases impossible for Mengoli's Six-Square Problem?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4342283/for-integers-xyz-why-are-these-cases-impossible-for-mengolis-six-square-pr) and got very helpful input for further investigation.
