The notebooks support the search for quadruples `[w,x,y,z]` of squares where the difference of each quadruple's element is again a square.

The notebook [pythagorean_mse.nb](https://github.com/Sultanow/pythagorean/blob/main/mathematica/pythagorean_mse.nb) has been developed by Bob Hanlon in [his post](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/262618/84438) at Mathematica Stack Exchange.
