## Use Arty's tool:
Create almost solutions: `python .\search_almost_Arty8.py "C:\Users\esultano\Downloads\cpp_solutions.3.4294967294" > almost.txt`

## Use Eldar's tool:

```bash
cd c:/users/esultano/git/pythagorean/python
c:/Users/esultano/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python search_almost_EldarSultanow.py > near_solutions.txt
```
